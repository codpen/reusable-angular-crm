# Reetek Angular CRM

> A simple reusable CRM project for real-world business based on Angular 4, Angular-Material & Bootstrap 3. 

This project starts from a popular starter project [AngularClass/AngularStarter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter). The goal of this project is to create reusable project for real-world business. To achieve this target, we need a solution which should include authentication process, restful API feature with token support and simple but elegant UI design. 

There is another similar project built on the Vue.js. If you are looking for reusable CRM project with Vue.js, please clone the repo Vue2Crm from [here](https://github.com/harryho/vue2crm.git).

#### Features

* This project is built on the top of AngularClass/Angular-Starter. 
* The UI part of this project combine Angular-Material and Bootstrap 3. Because the controls from Angular-Material is very limited, there are a few extra components require Bootstrap 3 for help. 
* This project includes ng-charts, pagination, progress-bar, confirmation dialog, etc. features.
* It uses Json-Server as fake Restful API. (You can simple replace it with your own API)
