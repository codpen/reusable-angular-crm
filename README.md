# Angular CRM

> A reusable CRM starter project for real-world business based on Angular 4, Angular-Material & Bootstrap 3. 

This project starts from a popular starter project [AngularClass/AngularStarter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter). The goal of this project is to create reusable project for real-world business. To achieve this target, we need a solution which includes simple authentication process, restful API feature with token support and simple but elegant UI design. 


#### Features

* This project is built on the top of AngularClass/Angular-Starter. 
* The UI part of this project combine Angular-Material and Bootstrap 3. The components from Angular-Material is very limited, and ng-bootstrap for Angular 4 was at Alpha version when I started this project, so I combine some Bootstrap 3 in this project to build the UI. 
* This project includes ng-charts, pagination, progress-bar, confirmation dialog, etc. features.
* It uses Json-Server as fake Restful API. (You can simply replace it with your own API)
* CRUD functions for Customer, Order and Product.
